# Forge

AI-assisted parallel development orchestrator.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install -e .

# Initialize in a project
cd your-project
forge init

# Add and start a feature
forge add "My Feature"
forge start my-feature
```

## Features

- **Feature Registry**: Track features with hierarchy and dependencies
- **Git Worktrees**: Parallel development via isolated worktrees
- **Smart Prompts**: AI-generated implementation prompts with expert consultation
- **Deep Research**: Automatic detection of features needing research
- **Merge Orchestration**: Safe, validated merging with conflict detection

## Philosophy

Built for "vibecoders" who work with AI assistance but may not be Git experts.
Forge handles the complexity so you can focus on features.
