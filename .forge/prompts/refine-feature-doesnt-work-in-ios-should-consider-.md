## Instructions

You're helping a vibecoder who isn't a Git expert.
Handle all Git operations safely without requiring them to understand Git.

**Engage plan mode and ultrathink before implementing.**
Present your plan for approval before writing code.

When implementing:
- Commit changes with conventional commit format
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Test on target device/environment

When human says "ship it":
- Run `forge merge refine-feature-doesnt-work-in-ios-should-consider-` to merge to main and clean up
- This handles: merge → build validation → worktree cleanup → done

Ask clarifying questions if the specification is unclear.
